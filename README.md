# Basic Fetch Practice

In this assignment, we will practice using the fetch API by making a callout to a statically hosted JSON file and using the returned data. In this case, the JSON file contains a list of objects representing users and we will be dynamically creating "cards" for user containing information about them.

# Requirements
- Must be responsive.  
  Use a layout system and media queries to ensure that the page looks responsive across many devices and screen sizes.  
- Dynamically create, add, and remove HTML elements.  
  Every "User Card" will be created and removed via your JavaScript.
- Fetch and use the returned data.  
  You will use the data fetched to to populate your dynamically created "User Cards."  
- Create two buttons to get and handle data.  
  You will create buttons that perform actions. The first fetches all the data and creates the "User Cards." The second fetches all the data, but filters out any User who has been employed at their company for 10 years or more. Generate cards for the remaining users and display them.
- Create a button to clear the cards.  
  This button will remove all the cards from page.
